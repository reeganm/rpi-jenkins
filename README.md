### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. The project was forked from Hudson after a dispute with Oracle. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the whole software development process, with now common things like continuous integration, but by further empowering teams to implement the technical part of a Continuous Delivery.

### Usage

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 reeganm/rpi-jenkins
```

This will store the workspace in /var/jenkins_home. All Jenkins data lives in there - including plugins and configuration.
You will probably want to make that an explicit volume so you can manage it and attach to another container for upgrades :

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins:/var/jenkins_home reeganm/rpi-jenkins
```

this will automatically create a 'jenkins' volume on docker host, that will survive container stop/restart/deletion.
